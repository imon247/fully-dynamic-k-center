	Introduction : <br><br>

	Big dataset analysis is becoming an increasingly recognized topic among various industries and theoretical studies. The financial industry sees a rise of competition to minimize the transaction cost with a tremendous amount of transactions carried out concurrently; social media platforms strive to process a large amount of database queries every second. It is critical to abstract the most representative data points to ease the pain of analyzing the entire dataset. Cluster analysis has been useful for partitioning a dataset into clusters, which serves convenience by allowing analyzing the representative element of each cluster.  However, as today’s dataset size grows at an exponential rate and data updates occur in a more flexible manner, a more dynamic approach of clustering is required. <br><br>

    Research by Hubert Chan, Arnaud Guerquin and Mauro Sozio put forward a k-center clustering algorithm under the fully dynamic adversarial model. While retaining the invariants of the underlying data structure and sticking to the objective to find k centers of the dataset, this algorithm allows arbitrarily inserting and deleting data points [ref], this is characterized as “fully dynamic”. Based on this research and more specifically, we will investigate the stability of clusters under this clustering algorithm. <br><br>

    In our work, we will simulate the fully-dynamic adversarial environment. This requires us to build a model in accordance with full dynamicity that supports random insertion and deletion. We are going to implement the original algorithm to which we feed the data. We will also develop and justify a reasonable stability-measuring method with inputs being pre-operation clustering and post-operation clustering. We will revise the algorithm and do cross-comparison on stability with the original algorithm, provided that the dataset experimented on remains the same. <br><br>

    Our project also considers the stability regarding the variation of datasets. We are to fix the probability distribution of the underlying data space and examine the stability of the partitioning results generated by the same clustering algorithm of distinct datasets under the same distribution. To describe it at a  higher level, we analyze the stability of the algorithm both vertically (in chronological order) and horizontally (by comparing it with revised versions). <br><br>
